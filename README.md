This library contains JNA bindings for interacting with the Discord Rich Presence API in Java.
It is based on the C++ implementation of the (_now deprecated_)
[discord-rpc](https://github.com/discord/discord-rpc) library.

---

<h2 align="center">Getting Started</h2>

In order to use the library, you will need to set up a Discord application. You can do this by
following these steps:

1. Create a new application on
   the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Retrieve the `APPLICATION ID` from the `General Information` page of your application. This is
   needed
   to initialise the Rich Presence.
3. Add the Rich Presence assets to your application by uploading the images you want to use on the
   Rich Presence page. You can also add a large and small image to the Rich Presence.

<h3 align="center">Adding the Library to Your Project</h3>

You can add the library to your project by adding the following repository and dependency to your
build file:

<h4 align="center">Gradle (build.gradle)</h4>

```groovy
repositories {
  maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}
```

```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.github.Kawaxte:discord-rpc:%VERSION%'
}
```

---

<h4 align="center">Maven (pom.xml)</h4>

```xml

<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>jitpack.io</id>
    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
```

```xml

<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.Kawaxte</groupId>
    <artifactId>discord-rpc</artifactId>
    <version>%VERSION%</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

---

<h3 align="center">Using the Library</h3>

The following code snippet shows how to use the library to set the Rich Presence state and details
for your application alongside the start timestamp (in seconds):

```java
public class Main {

  public static void main(String... args) {

    // Set the Discord Rich Presence event handlers to notify when the client is ready.
    DiscordEventHandlers handlers = new DiscordEventHandlers();
    handlers.ready = request -> {

      // Set the Rich Presence state to indicate the RPC test is running.
      DiscordRichPresence presence = new DiscordRichPresence.Builder()
          .setState("DiscordRPC Test")
          .setDetails("Running the RPC test")
          .setStartTimestamp(System.currentTimeMillis() / 1000L)
          .build();

      // Update the Rich Presence using the built presence.
      DiscordRPC.updatePresence(presence);
    };

    // Initialise the Rich Presence with the application ID and event handlers.
    DiscordRPC.initialise("APPLICATION_ID", handlers, true, null);

    // Update the Rich Presence periodically using ScheduledExecutorService as it is more
    // efficient than using a 'while' loop to update the Rich Presence.
    ScheduledExecutorService service = Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor();
    service.scheduleAtFixedRate(DiscordRPC::runCallbacks, 2, 2, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

    // Clear and shut down the Rich Presence when the application exits.
    Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(Executors.defaultThreadFactory().newThread(
        () -> {
          DiscordRPC.clearPresence();
          DiscordRPC.shutdown();
        }));

  }
}

```
